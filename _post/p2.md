# Project 2: Operators, expressions, and variables

## Learning Objectives:
In this project you will demonstrate your ability to:

- use arithmetic operators, including the floor division operator,
- call the type function on an expression,
- use logical operators such as `and`, `or`, and `not`,
- use comparison operators,
- store values and results of expressions into variables.

## Testing your code:

Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the file `public_tests.py`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the value of the variable `expected_json` (at line *62* of the file), to understand the expected answers to the questions. It is okay if you do not understand how this file works for now. We promise that you will be able to understand everything going on in that file by the end of this semester.

In the meantime, after answering each question (say Question 1), you can test your answer directly on the notebook by running the cell below that question which says (in the case of Question 1) `grader.check("q1")`. If you have answered the question **correctly**, you will see the following:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <img src="attachment:correct.png" width="900"/>
</div>

Instead, if you make a **semantic error**, you might see an error message similar to the one below:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <img src="attachment:semantic_error.png" width="900"/>
</div>

You can ignore the first few lines of this message. You need to focus on the very last line here. That is the line that begins with <b style="color:red">ERROR:</b>. This message will tell you what is wrong with your code so that you can hopefully fix it.

On the other hand, if you make any **syntax or runtime errors**, you might see an error message similar to the one below:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <img src="attachment:syntax_error.png" width="900"/>
</div>

Try figuring out by yourself, what this error message is telling you. As the course progresses, you will learn how to read the Traceback from your error messages. For now, try to avoid making syntax errors, and if you are unable to fix your code, attend office hours and have a TA or Peer Mentor look at your code.

## Submission and Grading:

After you finish answering all the questions, just click on `Kernel` -> `Restart & Run All` instead of running the last couple of cells. This will ensure that all your cells are run fresh, and that your notebook is saved before it is exported for submission.

After you finish this project, you will have to submit it via [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/), just as you did for [P1](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s24-projects/-/tree/main/p1). The Gradescope autograder will run some additional **hidden tests**, and your final grade will be based off those tests. These hidden tests will verify that your submission satisfies the requirements of the [rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-s24-projects/-/tree/main/p2/rubric.md), and will make deductions according to the rubric.

For example, if your code looked like this:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <img src="attachment:rubric_error.png" width="900"/>
</div>

then you would **pass the public tests** even though you have not met the conditions of the rubric. However, the Gradescope autograder wil **deduct points** from your score based on the rubric.

For example, if you turn in the above code, the Gradescope autograder will display the following message at the **bottom of the page**:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <img src="attachment:some_tests_fail_summary.png" width="900"/>
</div>

To see **more details** on what went **wrong** with your submission, you can scroll up to the individual tests (in this case, `q1` and `q2`) for the TEST DETAILS:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <img src="attachment:some_tests_fail_details.png" width="900"/>
</div>

If you think that the TEST DETAILS are either **unclear**, or **do not apply** to your submission, reach out to a TA or Peer Mentor.

If you have **not lost** any points on the Gradescope autograder, you will see this screen when the autograder has finished running:

<div>
    <p></p>
    <img src="attachment:all_tests_pass.png" width="900"/>
</div>

**Remember to check Gradescope ten to fifteen minutes after you make your submission.** That is roughly how long the Gradescope autograder will take to grade your submission, and the score that you see displayed on Gradescope after the tests run will be your **final project score**. If you lose points for any reason, you may fix the errors in your notebook and resubmit.

<h2 style="color:red">Important Warning:</h2>

If you completed the project with a **partner**, make sure to add their name by clicking `"View or edit group"` in Gradescope when uploading the P2 zip file. It is <span style="color:red"><b>not enough</b></span> if you include this information in this notebook. You **must** also add them on Gradescope.

### Boolean Word Problems

We're now going to do a few word problems. The most important skill you're going to learn in this class is translating English sentences to code. This will be good practice!

Here are simple example translations between English phrases and comparison operators:

"x is at most y" or "x is no more than y" &rarr; `x <= y`  
"x is less than y" or "x is below y" or "x is under y" &rarr; `x < y`  
"x is at least y" &rarr; `x >= y`  
"x is more than y" or "x is above y" &rarr; `x > y`  
"x is equal to y" &rarr; `x == y`  
"y is within the range of x and z" or "y is in between x and z" &rarr; `x <= y <= z`

You can use the above translations as verification for your Question 15 and Question 16 solutions.

**Question 15:** Suppose, the *safe operation weight limit* for a trailer is *3000 lbs*. Grace's trailer weighs *2000 lbs*. To safely operate the trailer, Grace needs to ensure that her trailer weight is *at most* the operation weight limit. How can Grace figure out if she can safely operate her truck? You **must not** change the variables' values.

**Hint**: Use the appropriate comparison operator.


```python
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CELL, KEEP THESE VARIABLES AS THEY ARE
TRAILER_LIMIT = 3000 # constants are typically stored in variable names with all capital case letters
trailer_weight = 2000
```


```python
# replace the ... with the correct expression
# we expect you to use the above variables
# INCORRECT ANSWER: safe_operation = True --> this is considered HARDCODING.
safe_operation =TRAILER_LIMIT>=trailer_weight

safe_operation
```




    True

**Question 16:** To safely pull a trailer of weight 2000 lbs, Rahul's truck should weigh between 1000 and 3000 lbs. How can Rahul figure out if his truck is heavy enough to operate the trailer? You **must not** change the variables' values.

**Hint**: Use the appropriate comparison operator.


```python
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CELL, KEEP THESE VARIABLES AS THEY ARE
LOWER_LIMIT = 1000 # constants are typically stored in variable names with all capital case letters
UPPER_LIMIT = 3000 # constants are typically stored in variable names with all capital case letters

```


```python
# replace the ... with the correct expression

**Question 19:** *red*, *green*, and *blue* are the primary colors. How can we correct the expression `color == "red" or "green" or "blue"` to correctly verify whether `color` is a primary color? You **must not** change the color variable's value.

**Hint**: In Lab-P2, there was a section on "Correct way to write boolean expressions". Now would be a good time to go back and refresh that.


```python
# DO NOT EDIT THIS CELL, KEEP THIS VARIABLE AS IT IS
color = "blue"
```


```python

**Question 20:** Students *Alice*, *Bob*, *Chang*, and *Divya* have exam scores of 31, 35, 34, and 35. The expression `alice_score + bob_score + chang_score + divya_score / 4` produces incorrect student average. How can we fix this expression to compute the correct average score? You **must** define, initialize, and use the score variables mentioned in the incorrect expression.

**Hint**: To override default operator order precedence, parentheses can be used, similar to PEMDAS.


```python
# create the required variables here
alice_score = 31
bob_score = 35
chang_score  = 34
divya_score= 35
# we expect you to define, initialize, and use the score variables mentioned in the original expression
# INCORRECT ANSWER: average_score = 33.75 --> this is considered HARDCODING.
average_score = (alice_score + bob_score + chang_score  + 35) / 4  # fix this expression
